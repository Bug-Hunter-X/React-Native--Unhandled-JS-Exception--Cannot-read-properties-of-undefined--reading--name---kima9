This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized. This commonly happens when you have asynchronous operations, such as API calls, that update state.  If the component renders before the state has been updated, you'll get an undefined value causing the app to crash.  For example, if you have a component that fetches data from an API and then updates a state variable with this data, and you try to display the data in the component before the API call has completed, you will run into this issue. 

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
      const jsonData = await response.json();
      setData(jsonData);
    };

    fetchData();
  }, []);

  // Error occurs here if data is accessed before it's set
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{data.name}</Text> {/* potential error here */}
    </View>
  );
};
```
